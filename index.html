        <p>1. Detecting your whereabouts</p>
           <p>The customer presses a button on a smartphone screen, and an app automatically detects the location for fuel delivery. The clients can use manual input to indicate a location.</p>
            
            <p>2. Specifying the product type</p>
            <p>Then, the user specifies what kind of fuel is needed and the quantity. Mobile services will usually offer a range of different gas types.</p>
            
           <p>3. Refueling your car</p>
            <p>Now, all the user has to do is wait for the service to arrive. Instead of actually going to a gas station, people can get a mobile fuel filling station to find them after detecting exactly where they are via GPS. The payment is charged after their tank is refilled.</p>
